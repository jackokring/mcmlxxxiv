# MCMLXXXIV

A `Fabric` Minecraft Mod. Instead of using `Forge` this time I'm trying the `Fabric` way. Maybe this module will get
further, or has got further. A few basic design decisions include:

 * No mine-ables. All items and blocks are recipe or brewing based.
 * All mobs are derivatives. So making and easy class extension and simple texture repaints.
 * Extra mobs are for AI ideas. Reasons for introducing mobs are to try new AI ideas.
 * No unexpected potion ingredients. All new brew recipes based on the unused potion ingredients.
 * Potion effects are not standard. Potions provide effects not just simple combinations of existing status effects.
 * No new tools. Every beginner mod seems to have a new tool level. Vanilla controls the tool progression.
 * New effect enchantments. Only new status effects have new enhancements.
 * Custom commands when useful. There's no point in just adding a command because you can.
 * No new structures. Vanilla has this sorted already.
 * New fluids have utility. Maybe interesting, depending on features.
 * Useful redstone. THere's no point in adding in things which are gimmicks.

## Items

 * `Fabric` a fungible currency/fuel. Also, the item group icon. Like a leveraged `Emerald`.
   Three white `Wool` plus six `Bonemeal` in a sandwich pattern makes three `Fabric`. A unique recipe.
